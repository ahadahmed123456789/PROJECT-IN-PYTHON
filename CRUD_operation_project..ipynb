    "# ðŸ”¹ What is pathlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "pathlib is a standard library in Python (introduced in Python 3.4) for handling filesystem paths in an object-oriented way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, developers used the os and os.path modules for file and directory operations. pathlib makes this easier and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ Key Features of pathlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses classes like Path to represent filesystem paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works seamlessly with both Windows and Linux/MacOS style paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-platform\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to worry about forward (/) or backward (\\) slashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readable & Clean Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations are done with operators and methods instead of string concatenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combines path manipulation & file operations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read/write files directly using path objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ Importing\n",
